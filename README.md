This is the third project in a series of projects within the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree program. In this project, adaptive montecarlo localization is used to localize a skid-steer robot with laser scanner in a known map of the world. 

Skid-steer robot with lidar:

Adaptive Monte-carlo locationzation of the robot: The red arrows in the screenshot indicate the particles that estimate the pose and covariance shown in green. The laser scan show that the known map is aligned with the walls.
